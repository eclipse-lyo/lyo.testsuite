In the past, 1 report was generated for multiple test runs (from multiple OSLC servers or from testing multiple capabilities). I decided that it will be easier to produce 1 SVG image and 1 report per each tested capability per OSLC server. The scripts in this directory are the original ones that operate on `testsuites` instead of `testsuite` (which is what we generate reports from and what Maven Surefire plugin generates).
